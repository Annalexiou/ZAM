        <br>
        <p>Having supportive people in your life is the key to stress management. If you lack emotional support and friendship, it's important to get it.
         That may mean reaching out to your existing network. Perhaps confiding in a family member or distant friend can help you become closer and it may give you the social support you need.
         You may also need to expand your network. Join an organization, attend a support group, or get professional help if you lack supportive people in your life. </p>
